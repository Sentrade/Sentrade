But the company's next big move in that space may be a contraction of sorts: Apple is considering a subscription bundle that would include Apple Music, Apple TV Plus, and Apple News Plus, according to a new report from Bloomberg's Gerry Smith and Mark Gurman.And that new bundle could arrive as soon as next year, in 2020, according to the report. The bundle of services that is said to be coming next year doesn't include Apple Arcade, the video game subscription service Apple launched in September.Starting with Apple Music in 2015, Apple has pushed hard into digital subscription services across the last several years.\u00a0In 2019 in particular, Apple has launched three major new subscription services: Apple News Plus, Apple TV Plus, and Apple Arcade.But with each new service comes a new monthly fee, and those monthly fees quickly add up.\u00a0Apple Music costs $10\/month, as does Apple News Plus, while Apple TV Plus costs $5\/month.That's $25 for all three, every month.Given that, it's likely that a bundle would potentially lower the overall cost for all three services \u2014 perhaps $20\/month for the trio, for instance. Notably, a previous report pointed to Apple bundling just two of its services: Apple Music and Apple TV Plus.\u00a0Apple has yet to officially announce such a bundle, and company representatives didn't respond to a request for comment as of publishing.","date":"2019-11-14"},{"source":"Business_Insider","url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/apple-is-considering-music-and-tv-plus-subscription-bundle-report-2019-10","title":"Apple reportedly considers Apple Music and TV Plus subscription bundle - Business Insider","text":"Apple TV Plus hasn't launched yet, but Apple has already considered packaging its on-demand video service with its streaming music service, Apple Music.A new report from Anna Nicolaou and Patrick McGee of the Financial Times says that Apple has entered into talks with the music industry to make a subscription bundle a reality, but record labels are concerned that they will lose revenue from the deal.Apple Music is a $10 monthly subscription, though Apple customers who buy an iPhone, iPad or Mac get one year of the service for free. Apple TV Plus will launch on November 1 for $5 per month, and will feature original TV shows, movies, and documentaries. Earlier this year, Apple launched Apple News Plus for $10 per month, and the $5 per month Apple Arcade, a subscription video game service.While Apple has not formally announced any plans to combine its growing list of subscription services, a discounted bundle would provide additional value to dedicated customers. However, the Financial Times report suggests that music industry executives are wary of accepting a deal that would lead to lower revenue shares from Apple Music streaming.According to the Financial Times, the music industry's skepticism goes back to the early days of Apple's iTunes store, when former Apple CEO Steve Jobs leveraged access to the growing digital marketplace to get record labels to agree to a price of $0.99 per song.The music industry has benefitted from the advent of streaming music service, but licensing negotiations remain a point of tension between streaming platforms and record labels. Industry executives told the Financial Times that Apple Music currently offers a more favorable rate of revenue sharing than Spotify, the world's most popular music streaming service.","date":"2019-10-07"},{"source":"Business_Insider","url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/new-apple-tv-fall-of-2015-says-gene-munster-2015-2","title":"New Apple TV fall of 2015, says Gene Munster - Business Insider","text":"Apple analyst Gene Munster says he thinks a new Apple TV could be launched this fall.\u00a0Here's what Munster said in a new note Thursday afternoon:With WWDC just four months away (likely June 2015), we believe talk about an update to Apple TV (not a television) could pick up over the next few months. Despite our belief in an actual television being unrealized so far, we continue to believe that TV is an area of focus for Apple and the most likely area for innovation now that the Apple Watch has been announced. We believe the most likely path to a TV would be an update to the Apple TV hardware and software that potentially integrates content, gaming, and HomeKit in the fall of 2015 and a television at least a year later. As we move toward the Apple Watch launch in April, we believe investors will be looking for the next big new product for Apple, which we believe will be focused around the TV.Catch that? He says he thinks an Apple TV update could be coming this fall.\u00a0Munster has long been wrong about Apple and the TV market. For years he's been saying Apple will release a television. And for years he has been wrong.\u00a0This report doesn't seem to be based off anything more than a hunch.\u00a0So, if you want to dismiss it, go right ahead. You would not be wrong.\u00a0However!It makes plenty of sense for Apple to update the Apple TV. The last update to the Apple TV came in January of 2013, according to MacRumors. It is running on the A5 chip. Apple's latest chip is the A8. By the fall, we should have an A9. What's the difference between an A5 and an A9? Roughly four As.So, the Apple TV is due for an upgrade.\u00a0Further, there were a flurry of reports last year that Apple was ready to release a new Apple TV.\u00a0But something went wrong.\u00a0The Apple TV is Apple's version of the same thing. Apple can load the Apple TV with sensors so it can tell when you're home or not home. It can be the hub that tells your lights to turn on when you're on your way home. It could do all sorts of things that we have yet to think about. It could also be like Amazon's Echo, an always on device that works with Siri.\u00a0Munster thinks an update to the Apple TV leads to an actual television in 2016 or 2017. We don't know about that.\u00a0But, Apple is very interested in the TV market. Steve Jobs talked about it before he died. Tim Cook talks about it in every interview, because he's asked about it in every interview. Why is he asked about it in every interview? Because people desperately want TV to be changed, and they think Apple is best company to do it.\u00a0Apple has yet to make a major move, but maybe this is the year when that finally happens.","date":"2015-02-13"},{"source":"Business_Insider","url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/former-apple-ceo-john-sculley-thinks-apple-watch-will-flop-2014-12","title":"Former Apple CEO John Sculley Thinks Apple Watch Will Flop  - Business Insider","text":"Former Apple CEO John Sculley gave his take on the Apple Watch and Apple Pay in a recent interview with Forbes.Sculley lauded Tim Cook's success as CEO, but said he doesn't think Apple takes enough risks.\"If you say who in Silicon Valley is willing to go out and take the big risks, change the game, you see people like Amazon and Google, Facebook, are willing to take big risks to go into entirely new industries than they were in before.\"Sculley said Apple will continue reaping insane profits even if they don't innovate new products.\"The question is: is there anything on the horizon,\" he said. \"I'm not convinced yet that the Apple Watch is one of those items. Maybe I'll be wrong. But it isn't clear to me that it's as big a deal as an iPhone, or an iPad, or an iPod.\"Keep in mind Wall Street expects Apple to sell in the neighborhood of 24 million Apple Watches next year.But despite Sculley's negativity about the Apple Watch, he's bullish about Apple Pay:I think Apple Pay can be a fundamental creative leap. Look what AliPay is doing. So I'm very optimistic about Apple Pay. But realistically, even if you're an optimist, it's going to take several years to deploy that around the world. And no retailer wants to bet 100% of their future just on Apple.At least some analysts share Sculley's optimism about Apple Pay:\u00a0pointing to services as a growth area for Apple\nGet the latest Google stock price here.","date":"2014-12-05"},{"source":"Business_Insider","url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/the-crowd-at-apples-new-store-near-foxconn-chants-apple-apple-apple-2012-11","title":"The Crowd At Apple's New Store Near Foxconn Chants: 'Apple!

Apple! Apple!\" and wave around expensive iPads and iPhones.As DeWitt reminds us, one of the most poignant details in Apple critic\u00a0Mike DaiseyDaisey is now saying this was because the iPad was not being sold in China at the time.But his implication seemed to be that Foxconn workers were too impoverished to ever even encounter such expensive gadgets.\u00a0That implication now seems false.But you still have to wonder if any of the people waving those gadgets around are actually Foxconn employees.\u00a0Though wages are supposed to double by next year,\u00a0Foxconn employees only make about $350 a month\u00a0 \u2013 which isn't enough to buy an Apple product unless you're really stretching.","date":"2012-11-06"}]
