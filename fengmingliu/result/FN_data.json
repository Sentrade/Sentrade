The same trends are, of course, seen in other rich countries, and many developing ones\u2014but coping with them will be harder in Europe, because of its half-formed union where workers can move freely and many countries share a currency, but where there is no common fiscal policy or strategy to deal with ageing.Investors are well aware of some of Europe\u2019s shortcomings. The sovereign-debt crisis showed that converging inflation and interest rates did not, by themselves, ensure a sustainable currency union or integrated banking system. Wage bargaining, regulation and so on need to converge to stop imbalances between countries building up. Less well understood is that demography could also tear the union apart.NoneSome countries will suffer even more. Spain and Italy are expected to lose more than a quarter of their workforce by 2050. Populations in the south and east are forecast to shrink by a tenth on average. With fewer workers, those countries risk seeing growth stagnate, even as rising spending on pensions and health services pushes up public debt.NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneEurope needs coherent policies if it is to hold together as it ages. Older people and women\u2014who tend to have lower employment rates\u2014should be encouraged into work. If Italian women were as likely to work as German ones, Italy\u2019s workforce would be 14% bigger. Matching older workers\u2019 employment rates would add 5%.Judging by France, providing cheap child care both encourages women into work and supports fertility rates, says Mr Scarpetta. Existing workers can be better trained; automation can supplement them. Improving education and investing in infrastructure could increase productivity. Governments can ensure that retirement ages keep pace with lifespans. All these policies would have the added benefits of attracting immigrants and convincing would-be emigrants to stay.NoneNoneNoneThis article appeared in the Finance and economics section of the print edition under the headline \"Demography could be yet another force for divergence within the EU\"Sign up to our free daily newsletter, The Economist todayNoneNone","date":"2020-01-11"},{"source":"Economist","url":"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/finance-and-economics\/2020\/01\/11\/why-price-controls-are-so-uncontrollably-persistent","title":"In a fix - Why price controls are so uncontrollably persistent | Finance and economics | The Economist","text":"New data from the World Bank show how much governments meddle in price-settingNoneNoneNoneThe ubiquity of price controls shows that economists have less influence than many people think. Few measures are as unpopular with the profession, which sees prices as both a signal of scarcity and a spur to overcome it. Controlling them scrambles the signal and blunts the spur. Price floors result in food rotting in warehouses. Ceilings lead to underinvestment, hoarding and black markets.Efforts to stabilise prices at home can increase volatility abroad. Export bans, for example, force farmers to sell domestically, worsening global shortages. The World Bank reckons that governments\u2019 attempts to insulate their countries from higher food prices accounted for 40% of the increase in world wheat prices in 2010-11.One reason not to impose price controls is that they are so hard to remove. \u201cWe struggled to find an example where it has gone very smoothly,\u201d says Franziska Ohnsorge, a lead author of the bank\u2019s \u201cGlobal Economic Prospects\u201d report. A fare increase last year on Santiago\u2019s metro of 30 pesos ($0.04) was the trigger for widespread unrest that brought Chile\u2019s army onto the streets and resulted in 29 deaths.When removing price controls, it helps to get the timing right. With ceilings, it is best to act when market prices are low. Ivory Coast, Mexico and Rwanda took advantage of the oil-price slump after 2014 to reduce their fuel subsidies. The bank also recommends linking the removal of price controls with offsetting measures to help the needy. Egypt, for example, increased spending on health and education after raising prices for gas, petrol and electricity. But not everyone was appeased. Many people who know that higher prices will hurt them doubt that higher social spending will ever help them.NoneThis article appeared in the Finance and economics section of the print edition under the headline \"Why price controls are so uncontrollably persistent\"Sign up to our free daily newsletter, The Economist todayNoneNone","date":"2020-01-11"},{"source":"Economist","url":"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/finance-and-economics\/2020\/01\/11\/the-killing-of-qassem-suleimani-sends-gold-to-a-seven-year-high","title":"Worth its weight - The killing of Qassem Suleimani sends gold to a seven-year high | Finance and economics | The Economist","text":"But the precious metal had already been on a long rallyNoneThe jump followed the drone strike that killed Qassem Suleimani, leader of the Quds Force of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, three days earlier.

Mr Schmelzing\u2019s data instead suggest that secular stagnation, insofar as it means falling interest rates, has been a feature of capitalism since its birth. Rates falling since the early 1980s may be less the result of acute problems, such as an ageing population, than markets simply snapping back to a centuries-old trend.The data also challenge some of the arguments of Thomas Piketty\u2019s \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century\u201d, one of the best-selling economics books of all time. These rely on the claim that the return on capital has stayed constant and been consistently higher than economic growth.

And his conclusion is that investors should avoid owning oil stocks.It is a call that raises hackles. Committees that set investment policies for pension funds fear that if they shun oil stocks it will be harder to reach their financial goals. Mr Grantham checked the data to find out whether, and how much, omitting the stocks of any industry over three decades would have hurt a hypothetical investor. He created synthetic portfolios that left out each of the ten broad stockmarket sectors and compared their returns with the market as a whole.NoneNoneMr Grantham believes that oil might yet prove an exception. Oil demand has already peaked in rich countries and, as climate fears grow and green technologies become cost-effective, it will eventually peak worldwide. But not everyone is keenly focused on this prospect. Scepticism regarding climate science is common in America. To the extent that sceptics are investors, and are betting on business as usual, at least some of the risks facing Big Oil may not be in the price.Investors might, for instance, miscalculate the speed of transition to greener energy. Advances in materials science and battery technology are making electric vehicles a cost-effective alternative to petrol-fuelled cars, Mr Grantham reckons. Other potential hazards face oil companies, including increased regulation and costly lawsuits. In other industries, such as tobacco, firms have been forced to pay up when found to have knowingly sold harmful products. He thinks the oil industry faces a similar reckoning.Is there also a moral case for disinvestment? An argument against is that oil firms are best placed to speed the transition to solar and wind power. They have experience of managing big projects in difficult terrain. And many would say that dumping oil stocks is a pointless salve to the eco-warrior\u2019s conscience. Bill Gates, a software mogul and philanthropist, has argued that people should not waste idealism and energy on a policy that will not cause any reduction in the use of fossil fuels. What matters are incentives set by governments: tax breaks to fund research in green energy; tax rises to discourage carbon use. But this misses the point, says Mr Grantham: \u201cYou have to make the oil industry a pariah for bad behaviour.\u201d Only then will politicians feel the need to act.A lot of finance types quietly suspect that greenery is anti-capitalism in metastatic form. Mr Grantham is clearly not of this anti-business persuasion. That makes it far harder to dismiss his arguments out of hand. \u201cThis is the first time that a major industry has been put on notice that it is going out of business, even if it may take a long time,\u201d he says.

Not so. The 2007-08 financial crisis and hedge funds\u2019 fading fortunes depleted the state\u2019s coffers. In response it raised taxes, triggering an exodus that has lessons for the rest of America about the risks of relying on low taxes to lure wealthy residents. And as Americans cool on small-town living, Greenwich is a reminder that even the most privileged enclave is not immune to national trends.A century ago Greenwich\u2019s selling points included the absence of mosquitoes and malaria. It has always been beautiful, too, with a white-sand beach and verdant surrounding hills\u2014and convenient for New York. The super-rich drawn by such delights built homes to match. In the early 1900s a Rockefeller built a 64-room mansion in the Georgian style. Other residents built replicas of Warwick Castle and the Petit Trianon at Versailles. One had a Tudor cottage dismantled, shipped from Britain and put together again.NoneSome financiers decided to skip the commute and make Greenwich their business base as well. It was the home of Long-Term Capital Management from its founding in 1994 to its implosion in 1998. By the early 2000s a third of its commercial property was occupied by hedge funds, and rents on Greenwich Avenue rivalled those on Park Avenue.Then came the crash, which wiped out many fund managers. To plug the hole in state finances, Connecticut increased income taxes three times. It then discovered the truth of the adage \u201ceasy come, easy go\u201d. In 2017 Mr Tudor Jones sold his hedge fund\u2019s Greenwich campus, trimmed staff and moved to nearby Stamford. Others moved to Florida, which still has no income tax\u2014and no estate tax. Mr Lampert moved his fund and family to Miami in 2012. Most of Wexford Capital\u2019s staff moved to Palm Beach in 2014. Mr Tudor Jones now lives in Palm Beach and has an office there.In the past decade Greenwich has also been at the sharp end of a national trend: as cities have become safer and nicer, Americans have become less keen on midsized towns. Its housing mix exacerbates the problem. Today\u2019s homebuyers prefer walkable neighbourhoods and are willing to trade space for location. Even the richest have cooled on vast back-country estates.Leaving Greenwich has therefore often meant accepting a low offer. Thomas Peterffy, the founder of Interactive Brokers, saw his 80-acre estate languish unsold for years after he left for Florida in 2015. Initially priced at $65m, it eventually sold for $21m. \u201cYou can\u2019t give away a house in Greenwich,\u201d Barry Sternlicht of Starwood Capital complained\u2014somewhat hyperbolically\u2014when he moved to Florida in 2016.Between 2015 and 2016 Connecticut lost more than 20,000 residents\u2014including 2,050 earning more than $200,000 per year. The state\u2019s taxable-income base shrank by 1.6% as a result, according to Marc Fitch at the Yankee Institute for Public Policy, a conservative think-tank. Its higher income taxes have bitten harder since 2018, when President Donald Trump limited state and local tax deductions from income taxable at the federal level to $10,000 a year.Greenwich offers two lessons for policymakers to ponder. The first is that low taxes can help create a business hub that, once established, survives when they are raised. It is still home to enough hedge funds that their clients visit frequently\u2014a good enough reason for hedge funds to be in town. Of the $3.6trn-worth of capital managed by hedge funds globally, $340bn is managed in and around Greenwich.NoneNoneBut the second policy lesson is that low taxes cut both ways. Some of those who found it easy to move in will also find it easy to move on. If Florida ever needs to raise taxes, it may find the same.NoneThis article appeared in the Finance and economics section of the print edition under the headline \"Why so many of America\u2019s financial elite have left Greenwich\"Sign up to our free daily newsletter, The Economist todayNoneNone","date":"2020-01-11"},{"source":"Economist","url":"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/finance-and-economics\/2020\/01\/11\/economists-grapple-with-rising-american-mortality","title":"Free exchange - Economists grapple with rising American mortality | Finance and economics | The Economist","text":"Understanding \u201cdeaths of despair\u201d will require fresh thinkingNoneAmerica\u2019s mortality crisis actually predates the financial crisis: mortality rates for white Americans without a degree have been rising since at least the early 1990s. But it seems to be worsening. Life expectancy in America fell for three consecutive years between 2014 and 2017 (the most recent year for which data are available). That has not happened since the 1910s, when Americans were brought low by war and Spanish flu. Rising death rates are caused in large part by the opioid epidemic, which began with prescription painkillers and expanded to street drugs such as heroin and fentanyl. But suicide and alcohol-related mortality have also risen precipitously. Opioids, reckon Ms Case and Mr Deaton, were fuel on a fire already burning.The crisis resists simple explanations. There is no simple causal link between rising unemployment or inequality, for instance, and rising mortality. In a forthcoming book Ms Case and Mr Deaton offer a more nuanced argument. They reckon that a fundamental unfairness in the American economy contributes to indicators of economic dysfunction, such as high inequality, and also creates the conditions for the mortality crisis. They point to a health-care system that, enabled by dysfunctional markets and pliant regulators, plied Americans with prescription painkillers.The health-care industry has also redistributed income upwards. Doctors represent 16% of the top 1%, and 6% of the top 0.1%, of the American income distribution. Costs are much higher than in other countries, and outcomes are worse. Employer-provided health benefits soak up an ever-greater share of worker compensation, which might otherwise be paid as higher wages. The burden of benefits encourages firms to outsource jobs, leading to more insecure, dead-end sorts of employment. Not all of the American economy functions this way. But enough of it does to leave many less-skilled Americans stuck in jobs of low quality and potential, even as the rich and well-educated prosper mightily.NoneIt is possible, though, that the answer to the mortality question lies beyond the normal scope of economics. Ms Case and Mr Deaton note that rising mortality among white Americans has occurred alongside other, potentially related trends. These include not only worsening economic prospects, but also falling rates of marriage, church attendance and membership in community organisations. In citing these factors they take a leaf from Robert Putnam\u2019s book, \u201cBowling Alone\u201d, published in 2000, which argued that America was undergoing a long, steady decline in \u201csocial capital\u201d\u2014the strength of civic and community connections.NoneMr Putnam\u2019s analysis is suggestive rather than conclusive. Although some social pathologies, such as a turn toward nationalism and xenophobia, have spread globally, nothing like America\u2019s mortality crisis can be found in other rich countries. If he is right, they must not have experienced the same weakening of collective institutions and sentiments.NoneThis article appeared in the Finance and economics section of the print edition under the headline \"Economists grapple with rising American mortality\"Sign up to our free daily newsletter, The Economist todayNoneNone","date":"2020-01-11"},{"source":"Economist","url":"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/finance-and-economics\/2020\/01\/02\/the-causes-of-a-booming-stockmarket-are-unlikely-to-last-through-2020","title":"Christmas bonus - The causes of a booming stockmarket are unlikely to last through 2020 | Finance and economics | The Economist","text":"Global growth, a trade deal and lower rates have added oomph to sharesNEW YORKNoneNoneShare prices often rise when expectations of future profits do. But earnings have stagnated recently, so that does little to explain this year\u2019s boom. Falling interest rates played a bigger part. These boost share prices by increasing the comparative value of claims to future income streams, such as profits. The Federal Reserve, which had finished 2018 signalling that it would tighten monetary policy, changed course early in 2019 and indicated that it would ease if necessary to offset any shocks caused by the trade war. Market predictions for policy rates tumbled. During the year the Fed cut three times, undoing nearly all the previous year\u2019s tightening.After turbulence in the repo market, the Fed also started to expand its balance-sheet by buying short-dated Treasuries. The move was billed as a technical solution to problems in an essential part of the financial system, not as an economic stimulus. But it may have acted as one, all the same. After the financial crisis a decade ago, the Fed\u2019s swelling balance-sheet was credited with driving a stockmarket rally.December\u2019s market oomph seems to have come from a mini trade deal between America and China. America cancelled planned new tariffs on Chinese goods and cut some already in force. China agreed to buy more American goods.It was a good year not just for stocks, but for most financial assets, including corporate debt, government bonds, commodities and gold. That is unusual. When risky assets such as stocks and high-yield corporate debt are rising, safer ones such as government bonds and gold generally fall. Investors flock from risk to safety in times of crisis, and back again when the outlook improves. But when policy interest rates fall, bond yields generally do too; and thus bond prices rise. Loose monetary policy also tends to boost commodity prices. Broad indices of American bond prices rose by 9% in 2019. The price of gold rose by 19%.A bumper year, then. But what of 2020? The potent combination of monetary easing and evaporating risks to growth seems largely played out.

The more low-wage workers a company employed, they found, the more its profits declined. Companies with 60-80% of staff earning the minimum wage saw their profits cut by almost half.The researchers\u2019 central insight is that firms with relatively low profits disproportionately employed minimum-wage workers, meaning those firms ultimately bore the greatest burden of mandated higher wages. Poorer business owners suffered bigger losses. Those on median incomes (for the population at large) took a profit hit 8% larger than those at the 75th percentile.Since business owners with low earnings relative to their peers are still relatively well off compared with the general population, raising the minimum wage is still progressive. But it may seem unfair, as low-income businesspeople pay, but richer business owners and better-off employees do not. Those lower-income bosses who were hardest hit by minimum-wage increases earned only about as much as many mid- to high-earning workers. And a higher minimum wage is less progressive than raising taxes, which fall most heavily on the best-off, in order to fund tax credits for the poor. America\u2019s earned-income tax credit works along these lines.In some places, minimum-wage rules are designed to try to minimise the impact on low-earning firms. In America they apply only to businesses with sales exceeding a certain threshold. In South Korea, a minimum-wage increase in 2018 was accompanied by subsidies for small firms. The authors do not discuss how Israel\u2019s lack of such provisions might affect their findings.

The unemployment rate, noted Ms Ocasio-Cortez, had fallen by three percentage points since 2014, yet inflation was no higher. Might the Fed\u2019s estimates of the lowest sustainable jobless rate have been too high in recent years? \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d replied Mr Powell. The once-strong link between unemployment and inflation, known as the Phillips Curve, was a \u201cfaint heartbeat\u201d, he said.Inflation now seems no more pressing a worry than other diseases of the distant past\u2014smallpox, say, or scurvy. Even central bankers, who are paid to be anxious, tend to fret that inflation in rich countries might stay too low, not that it might suddenly surge. Investors may see it differently. The whole edifice of asset prices is founded on the expectation that inflation\u2014and thus interest rates\u2014will stay low. An unexpected rise in inflation ought to be the thing investors are most determined to guard against.Inflation clearly does not behave as it used to. It no longer goes up automatically when unemployment goes down. Perhaps this is because people have come to expect low inflation. Wages and prices are marked up less often and so are less responsive to slackness or tightness in the jobs market. Global supply chains mean local bottlenecks have less influence on prices.For much of the decade that has just ended, central banks kept interest rates unusually low. This has had as little effect on inflation as low unemployment has. One explanation is the desire of ageing workers to set aside more of their income for retirement. This in turn has pushed down the equilibrium interest rate that balances the supply and demand for savings\u2014with knock-on effects for asset prices. Rock-bottom bond yields reflect a belief that central banks will keep interest rates low indefinitely. And if bond yields stay low, expected returns on other assets (the earnings yield on equities, the rental yield on property and so on) will also stay low\u2014and their prices will remain high.A serious burst of inflation would change all that. It would be a sign that the low-interest-rate equilibrium had shifted. That would upset the constellation of high asset prices. For investors with portfolios stuffed with richly priced stocks, there is a strong reason to seek hedges against unexpected inflation. High-quality government bonds are the traditional diversifier for equity risk. But when inflation strikes, long-term nominal bonds are the worst assets to own. One way for the cautious to protect themselves is simply to hold more cash. Central banks would surely respond to a surge in inflation by raising short-term interest rates, thus boosting the returns on cash (with a delay).NoneNoneReasonable people might ask: \u201cWhy bother?\u201d Inflation has been slain. The fear that it is just around the corner led to investment mistakes and policy errors during the 2010s. Fair enough. But the reasons for quiescent inflation in the face of low unemployment and the secular decline in interest rates are not fully understood. A decade from now, a successor to Mr Powell may be explaining to Congress how the Fed had undercooked its inflation forecasts.This article appeared in the Finance and economics section of the print edition under the headline \"Why the most important hedge is against unexpected inflation\"Sign up to our free daily newsletter, The Economist todayNoneNone","date":"2020-01-02"},{"source":"Economist","url":"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/finance-and-economics\/2020\/01\/02\/chinas-industrial-policy-has-worked-better-than-critics-think","title":"Free exchange - China\u2019s industrial policy has worked better than critics think | Finance and economics | The Economist","text":"But the state-led model is creakingNoneThis raises an obvious question: does industrial policy work? Since at least Jean-Baptiste Colbert, France\u2019s finance minister under Louis XIV in the 17th century, governments have used taxes, tariffs and subsidies to cultivate national champions. Colbert worried about the dominance of Venetian glassmakers; Mr Xi worries about the dominance of American chipmakers.In principle industrial policy looks attractive. When markets are highly imperfect\u2014a fact of life in developing countries\u2014governments can use their muscle to stimulate activities that would otherwise be unthinkable for private entrepreneurs. When such policies succeed, the targeted sectors flourish, as South Korea\u2019s chemicals industry did in the 1970s. That, in turn, can lead to technological advances and productivity gains for the wider economy.But in practice industrial policy is hard to get right. Helping companies is as likely to promote laziness as competitiveness. Moreover, officials may be no better\u2014and perhaps much worse\u2014than businesspeople in choosing which industries to support.Although China is far from alone in deploying industrial policy, it stands out for the sheer scale of its efforts. Since the 1980s it has produced dozens of plans and lavished public spending on sectors from solar power to film-making. One industry has been a big unintended beneficiary: the academic study of industrial policy. A large and growing economic literature considers China\u2019s record.A recent volume, edited by Loren Brandt of the University of Toronto and Thomas Rawski of the University of Pittsburgh, examines the electricity and telecommunications sectors. These are natural candidates for government intervention, given the high cost of building power grids and phone networks, plus the benefits to society. But China has done more than build basic systems; it has also tried to reach the frontier of global innovation.NoneOne tentative conclusion is that China\u2019s industrial policy works better when natural monopolies are involved. There is a clear role for a central authority with strong organising power to develop a power-transmission system or a high-speed rail network. Yet that same authority can stifle competition in sectors that need it. Alternatively, as often occurs in China, if lots of provincial governments try to foster their own champions, nominally in pursuit of national objectives, the outcome is extreme over-capacity, which undermines the targeted sector.China\u2019s shipbuilding industry provides a textbook example. Panle Jia Barwick and Nahim Bin Zahur, both of Cornell University, and Myrto Kalouptsidi of Harvard University estimate in a recent paper that between 2006 and 2013 the government directed policy support worth 550bn yuan (roughly $80bn at the time) to shipbuilders. Most went as subsidies for entrants to the sector, attracting subpar firms. China became the world\u2019s biggest producer of ships. But the increase in net profits was just a fifth of the subsidies. Even the electricity sector, an ostensible success, is plagued by excess. A well-run power network should have back-up generating capacity equivalent to about 15% of peak load. The average among China\u2019s provinces is more than 90%.That, though, is not the end of the story. Ultimately, the value of industrial policy is in its wider economic impact. In a separate paper, Ernest Liu of Princeton University argues that state support is most effective when it targets those sectors that make the most essential inputs for others. Generally, these are upstream; turning raw materials into products used in a range of industries. Subsidies for them, even via state firms, can raise overall efficiency. As it happens, China has focused its support on the right sectors in Mr Liu\u2019s calculations, such as steelmaking and machinery. China, put bluntly, might never have become the economic power that it is today without ambitious industrial policy.Mr Liu\u2019s model does not indicate when subsidies are too high, nor does it set out how best to design policies. There is evidence that China\u2019s heavy-handed intervention is becoming increasingly ineffective. Total factor productivity growth in China in recent years has been a third of what it was before the 2008 global financial crisis (see chart). Productivity has also slowed in other countries, but the World Bank, in a recent book about Chinese innovation, notes that China\u2019s slowdown has been unusually sharp.After conducting extensive case studies of the vehicle and renewable-energy sectors, among others, the bank ascribes some of the blame to Chinese industrial policies that undermine fair competition. It argues that rather than targeting support at specific firms, China should shift to more market-oriented policies. Even-handed regulations and incentives, which treat state firms no differently from private companies or foreign investors, would do more than lavish subsidies to promote entrepreneurship.NoneThis article appeared in the Finance and economics section of the print edition under the headline \"China\u2019s industrial policy has worked better than critics think\"Sign up to our free daily newsletter, The Economist todayNoneNone","date":"2020-01-02"},{"source":"Yahoo_Finance","url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/millennial-homebuyers-are-drawn-to-one-pricey-us-metro-area-173559557.html","title":"Millennial homebuyers are drawn to one pricey US metro area","text":"It is no secret that millennials flock to trendy, low-cost cities. But bargains may not be the sole factor driving millennial homeownership, according to a new study that identified U.S. cities with the highest percentage of prospective millennial homebuyers.\u00a0None\u201cThere is a narrative that in the least affordable cities, like cities in California and New York City, that millennials are priced out. This study suggests this is not the case,\u201d said Tendayi Kapfidze, chief economist at LendingTree.A down payment for a home in San Jose averaged $148,098 compared to only $31,812 in Minneapolis and $20,777 in Buffalo, N.Y. \u2014 the two most popular cities among millennials, according to the study. Requested loan amounts in San Jose exceeded $647,000; compared to $219,590 in Minneapolis and $137,739 in Buffalo.Millennials in San Jose are more likely able to afford to buy houses because of their high credit scores and salaries, said Kapfidze. Millennials in the Silicon Valley city have an average 720 credit score, the study said. According to 2019 U.S. Census data, householders 25 to 44 had an annual median income of $132,609, roughly double the $65,879 median income for that\u00a0age group in the U.S.With a trendy downtown feel and cheap home prices, Minneapolis was the unsurprising top hub for millennial homebuyers. In Minneapolis, 56.2% of home loan applicants were millennials, the study found.But it\u2019s not just the trendy, active, urban feel of the city that attracts young homebuyers. Part of that comes from a low barrier to entry in home prices. The average down payment is $31,812; and the average loan is $219,590.Buffalo, the second largest city in the state of New York, ranked No. 2 on the LendingTree study with 56.1% millennial homebuyers because it is also a low-cost option. The average down payment for a home in Buffalo is $20,777 and the average loan requested amount is $137,739.\u00a0\u201cThe key requirement [for buying a house] is to have that down payment. The larger that down payment, the longer it\u2019s going to take to save up and have it ready,\u201d said Kapfidze.Meanwhile, the smallest percentage of millennial homebuyers, about 40% to 43%, are in Phoenix, Jacksonville, Fla., Tampa, Fla., Las Vegas, and Miami. Most of those markets are retirement destinations which predominantly attract Baby Boomers and Gen Xers, said Kapfidze.\u00a0NoneRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceNoneMore from Sarah:Rich millennials are like their older cohorts: studyThe ZIP codes where you can find the cheapest rent in the USThis new startup claims it will help you buy a home without a mortgage","date":"2020-01-09"},{"source":"Yahoo_Finance","url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/trump-tariffs-cost-consumers-163409804.html","title":"Confirmed: American businesses and consumers are paying 'approximately 100%' of Trump tariff costs","text":"None\u201cU.S. tariffs continue to be almost entirely borne by U.S. firms and consumers,\u201d the NBER working paper stated. \u201cSimilarly, we also find that the substantial redirection of trade in response to the 2018 tariffs has accelerated.\u201dNoneNoneNoneNoneNone\u201cWhile the longer-term effects of the tariffs may differ from those that we estimate here, the results indicate that the tariffs, thus far, have not led to increased activity in the U.S. manufacturing sector,\u201d the Fed study stated.None\u201cThe data show that U.S. tariffs have caused foreign exporters of steel to substantially lower their prices into the U.S. market,\u201d NBER\u2019s paper stated. \u201cThus, foreign countries are bearing close to half the cost of the steel tariffs.
